<p>Usufruct is a legal concept referring to a right in property which confers on the holder the right to use and benefit from the property without altering, damaging, or destroying it. A usufructary does not own the property but does have a legal interest in it which is sanctioned or contractually allowed by the owner.</p>

<p>A usufructary has two of the three civilian property property interests in the property, <em>usus</em> and <em>fructus</em>— they do not have the interest of <em>abusus</em>, which entitles them to alienate, destroy, consume or sell the property.</p>

<h2 id="the-three-civilian-property-interests">The three civilian property interests:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Usus:</strong> The right to use or enjoy a thing posessed, directly and without alteration</li>
  <li><strong>Fructus:</strong> The right to derive profit from a thing possessed, eg. by lease, cultivation, taxing on entry, etc. <em>Fructus</em> (from ‘fruit’) allows a person to benefit from the sale of renewable commodities of the property.</li>
  <li><strong>Abusus:</strong> The right to consume, destroy, or transfer the property. This interest is not conferred upon the usufructary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Roman law considered usufruct a type of personal servitude, where the usufructary had no posession of the property. Under a rental agreement today, a person has even more restricted rights over a property than did a usufructary in Rome, but is yet not considered a personal servant.</li>
  <li>The Law of Modes directed owners of productive property not to harvest the edges of their fields so that the poor may collect the gleanings. This confers a kind of usufructary right by default onto the poor.</li>
  <li>“Earth belongs – in usufruct – to the living.” (Thomas Jefferson).</li>
