<p>In abu dhabi they do not have a functioning residential postal system. everyone has a PO box, and most people don’t have even a street number. addresses look like this: SW-17 Plot 46A Villa B M’eshad First, Al Fahad City, Abu Dhabi, UAE. they call residential neighbourhoods that you could walk across in 10 mins ‘cities’, and some ‘villages’ are as big as ‘cities’. if you type an abu dhabi address into google maps it has no idea where it is.</p>
