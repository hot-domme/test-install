<p>These can usually be found in a Chinese grocer as a single mix, but buying each separate and in bulk avoids packing markup— you can store a giant glass jar of this for years, cheaply, and only have to buy fresh chicken.</p>

<p>Any kind of chicken is fine, but chicken with bones, like a Maryland or a whole spatchcock (small chicken) works best.</p>

<p>Prepare:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rinse, dry and salt chicken. Let sit for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Place herbs, water and chicken in a pot and bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer.</li>
  <li>Occasionally check in to remove solids from surface of soup or add water if needed.</li>
  <li>Cook for 1-4 hrs — 50% reduction is ideal.</li>
  <li>Remove chicken and chop to serving size. Season soup with salt and serve in a bowl.</li>
</ul>
