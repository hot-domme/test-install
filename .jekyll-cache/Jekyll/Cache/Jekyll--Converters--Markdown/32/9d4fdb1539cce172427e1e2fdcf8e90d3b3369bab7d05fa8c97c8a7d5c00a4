OK guys, I’m caught up.
I’m finally caught up on Web3, and Urbit, and the Assembly in Austin, and the Wet Brain Panel, and Ethereum scalability, and the distinction between optimistic and zero-knowledge ETH rollups, and Arbitrum (which idc about), and I read the Wikipedia page for Merkle tables, and I learned what shard chains are, and I kind of gave up on figuring out templeDAO unless someone can really make it exciting for me.</p>
