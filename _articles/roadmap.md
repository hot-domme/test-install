Read more: [exocore](exocore.md)

- Fix library link generation
- jekyll vscode snippets for convenience
- Create next-prev buttons for daily notes
  

## Twitter archive generator

- For online twitter profiles
- python XML parser / Webcrawler eg: BeautifulSoup4

## Future Exocore additions:

-  RTiRC Embed
- RSS Feed aggregator and 'Network' page
- @ing function
  - For twitter profile (easy)
  - For direct link to exocore (more difficult)

## Stack:
- 'Copy as markdown' browser extension for pausing and storing research sources
- Shell scripts
  - >buildblog
  - >serveblog
  - >news
  - >buildcrypt
  - >note
- alias folder for notes 
- VScode development workspace and separate notetaking workspace (simplified)

## To do:
- fix links
- move to netflify
- figure out which step of siterender is adding class "markdown-body" unnecessarily
- implement tag function, sort by tags, autogenerate page for each tag
- build related posts sidebar (by tag)
- backlinks
- make YAML front matter autopopulate date
- Fix typography conflict
  - note: current body font originates in /_sass/primer-support/lib/variables/typography.scss
- need primer sass files? if not, delete
- give each tag on /tags page an autogenerated anchor link
- make each listed tag in 'tags' sidebar an anchor link to the tag
- find a way to call on ALL pages for tags rather than by category
- evaluate utility of collections
- input configuration data for easy customisability
- change default date
